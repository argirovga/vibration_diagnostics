# Vibrations analytics using high-speed and neuromorphic cameras
This repository hosts a pioneering project aimed at revolutionizing vibration diagnostics through the integration of neuromorphic computing and high-speed cameras. Our goal is to democratize access to advanced vibration analysis techniques, making them accessible to everyone.

### Overview
Vibration analysis plays a crucial role in various fields, including structural health monitoring, mechanical engineering, and industrial maintenance. Traditional methods often require expensive equipment and specialized expertise, limiting their widespread adoption. Our project seeks to overcome these barriers by leveraging cutting-edge technologies and computer vision algorithms.

### How It Works (Key features of the algorithm)
- Retrieving data from either transformed frames of the high speed camera or even-frames created by event-based camera and to enhance the final results and ease the execution of other steps of algorithm: clearing, normalizing and denoising the obtained frames.
- Frames correlation and template matching. The part is aimed at finding the region of the source frame that matches the given image-template as closely as possible, using the normalized mutual correlation function to estimate the degree of correlation without scaling or rotating the template (this is a planned implementation of template matching and may eventually use another more optimized version if appropriate)
- Visualization. The plan is to develop a user-friendly application in which all interaction and results will take place.
